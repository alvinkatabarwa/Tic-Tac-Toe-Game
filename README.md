Instructions
UI/Preliminary scene
Create a UI transition with at least 2 pages of UI.

The first page is a title page with a button that transitions to the next page
The second page is a settings page showing different settings using more UI elements such as sliders, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc.
These UI elements don't have to be implemented/functional, they can be there for design purposes at this point.
Other pages you might want to include
Use Unity's Conditional Compilation to show platform-based UI elements or designs.
